In this analysis, I explored the Iris dataset from sklearn.
I focused on the relationship between sepal length and petal length.

The scatter plot and correlation plot show a strong positive correlation:
as sepal length increases, petal length also increases.

The regression line clearly demonstrates this trend, indicating that
these two features are closely related in the Iris dataset.
